The DriverPass project focused on designing a system for a client who wanted to provide driver education services online and in-person. The client needed a system that allowed customers to sign up, schedule lessons, make payments, and access practice tests.

One thing I did particularly well was creating a clear UML diagram that identified the main classes and their relationships. This provided a solid blueprint for how the system would function.

If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the level of detail in the requirements documentation. I would make the use cases more specific by adding alternate flows and error handling, which would give developers more clarity when implementing the system.

I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on the tasks that mattered most to them: scheduling, payments, and test preparation. Translating those needs into system requirements ensured that the design would be both functional and user-friendly. It’s important to prioritize user needs because a system that doesn’t solve real problems or feels confusing to navigate won’t be adopted successfully.

When designing software, I try to break down the system into smaller, manageable components and visualize relationships through diagrams. In the future, I would continue to use UML, but also add user stories and wireframes to capture both functionality and usability. I would also rely more on iterative design—getting feedback early and making adjustments before the system is built.
